The composition is a tight, centered book cover frame with a dramatic low-angle view, making the figure a tall, constrained silhouette against the cold window light, the camera focusing on the contrast between the deliberate, quiet action of his hands and the oppressive stillness of the room. The lighting is stark, high-contrast chiaroscuro with a cool, muted color palette of slate grey, charcoal, dull gold, and ash white, punctuated only by the warm, dying ember glow of the burning paper in his hands. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev"
