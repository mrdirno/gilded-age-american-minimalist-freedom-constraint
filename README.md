## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character maps a complex moral or financial obligation as a physical diagram or abstract drawing.
- Create a conversation between two minimalist characters where every word is a calculated transaction, and an unspoken debt is created.
- Imagine a Gilded Age tycoon who has built an empire on a single, seemingly trivial principle. Defend that principle against a pragmatic dismantler.
- Describe a character performing a daily ritual of 'erasure'—burning a page, washing a slate, deleting a file—to achieve mental freedom. What happens the day the ritual fails?

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a 'Constraint Visualizer' tool that allows a user to input obligations (time, money, social) and generates a unique, abstract line drawing representing their personal 'debt map'.
- Design a text-based game where the player is a fixer like Henry. Resources are not money or items, but 'lines of obligation' you must draw, manipulate, and erase to solve problems.
